Spanning tree is the subset of graph G which has covered all the vertices V of graph G 
with the minimum possible number of edges. Hence we say that a spanning tree doesn’t 
contain any loop or cycle and it cannot be disconnected.

For a disconnected graph, there will be no spanning tree possible because it is impossible 
to cover all the vertices for any disconnected graph.

So, for every connected and undirected graph has at least one spanning tree is possible.

Hence some properties of spanning tree:-

Spanning tree has V-1 number of edges where V is the number of vertices.
For a complete and undirected graph has maximum possible spanning tree for n number of 
vertices will be n^(n-2)
Spanning tree doesn’t have any loops and cycle.
Now see the diagram,





For weighted graph G=(V,E), where V={v1,v2,v3,…..} E={e1,e2,e3,e4………}

Minimum spanning tree is defined by a spanning tree which has minimum weight than all 
others spanning trees weight of the same graph.

Here we will learn about the two most important algorithms to find the minimum spanning the 
tree of graph G,

PRIM’S algorithm.
KRUSKAL’S algorithm.
Here we see the example of weighted Graph G and use the algorithm to find the MST.
